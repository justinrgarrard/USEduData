# US Educational Data Processor

A codebase that pulls U.S. educational data from various sources and converts
them into a form convenient to programmers.

**NOTE**: Project is in development.

**NOTE**: Data is too large for a GitHub repo. Working on a hosting solution.

### Data Contents

* **Demographics**: Drawn from the NCES (National Center for Educational Statistics).
A breakdown of students enrolled in schools by age, race, and gender.

* **Financial Status**: Drawn from U.S. Census Bureau records.
A breakdown of school districts by revenue and expenditure.

* **Academic Achievement**: Drawn from NAEP data (National
Assessment of Educational Progress) collected by the NCES
and SAT data collected by CollegeBoard. A breakdown of
student performance as assessed by the corresponding exams.


The current version of this data is concerned with state-level patterns. It is the author's hope that future versions will allow for school district-level granularity.

*Note: The licensing of this data states that it must not be used to identify specific students.*
